Miner based on [CCMiner v2.2.5 by @tpruvot](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases/tag/2.2.5-tpruvot)
Default GPU mining pool created by @TylerAnder

With GPU mining, you can now mine Ferrite 10x faster* than CPU mining while in the background, allowing your CPU to be free to perform other non-gaming/graphical tasks. 
* Assuming you have a discrete graphics card.
