### Changes
This release now has Windows Installers as well as static builds for Mac OS and Linux.
Atomic unit for Ferrite is atom.
Included in this release is a GPU pool miner based on [CCMiner v2.2.5 by @tpruvot](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases/tag/2.2.5-tpruvot) created by @TylerAnder. GPU mining is oftentimes much faster than CPU mining.

From v1.2.0 there will be few changes since most of the early changes have been fixed for now.
