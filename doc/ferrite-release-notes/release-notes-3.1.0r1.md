MWEB will be fully deployed when **97.5%** of miners add the 'mweb' rule and include MWEB transactions. This is determined by windows of 40 blocks, where 39 blocks will be the cut-off. 

**When this consensus occurs, all blocks must require the additional 'mweb' rule and include MWEB transactions.**
Till this happens, the 'mweb' rule is optional and MWEB transactions may need to wait in the mempool until a block is mined by a miner that includes MWEB transactions. 

MacOS currently compiled and tested on Monterey 12.0.1.
Compatible for MacOS Big Sur 11 and MacOS Ventura 13.
