## Changes
Segwit addresses are generated by default. New checkpoint at Block 60,000.
Added new documentation and about page changes.
Added built-in addnodes for the following pools.
[coinXpool](coinxpool.com) 
[Findblocks Pool](findblocks.net) 
[MiningMyPool](miningmypool.com)

### Future changes
Newly added pools and future checkpoints (Block 100,000) will be added to addnodes on version 1.3.1.
Minor stability changes.
Version 2.0.0-a will contain the upcoming Taproot and MWEB update for Ferrite Core from Bitcoin Core and Litecoin Core respectively. Taproot will increase theoretical transaction capacity, reducing fees and MWEB can provide greater privacy and anonymity to transactions.

Included in this release is a stratum-pool miner based on [CCMiner v2.3.1 by @tpruvot](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases/tag/2.3.1-tpruvot) with new pool configurations.
ASIC mining is recommended over GPU and CPU mining. You can opt to rent an Scrypt ASIC.

Everyone is invited to pull ferrite-core to suggest feature updates/chain parameters.
