Miner based on [CCMiner v2.2.5 by @tpruvot](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases/tag/2.2.5-tpruvot)
Default GPU/FPGA/ASIC mining pool created by @TylerAnder
Litecoin / Dogecoin Scrypt ASICs are compatible with ASIC mining on Ferrite. The executables can be obtained from your ASIC manufacturer.

With GPU mining, you can now mine Ferrite 10x faster* than CPU mining while in the background, allowing your CPU to be free to perform other non-gaming/graphical tasks. 
* Assuming you have a discrete graphics card.
With ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) mining, you can mine up to 1000x faster compared to GPU mining.
